# Start-up_Projects
Please go easy on my coding skills, I'm early in my IT journey with no work experience. So any advice will be great.<br />

In the "Basic_Projects" folder you can find basic projects that helped me to form a foundation in python. 
This folder includes simple projects with or without GUI.<br />

The rest of the folders contain slightly more advanced projects based on CRUD principles. (Python for code - MySQL for database)<br />
